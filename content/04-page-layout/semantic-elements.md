## Structure using Semantic tags

- Similar to `<div>`s, semantic tags are container elements

- HTML5 introduced semantic tags that directly communicate type of content the container element contains

- Important note: incorrect use of the tags will not result in any errors (but may be confusing for your teammates)


- Above picture is just an example! This structure is not set in stone, use what makes sense for your project

Make sure you distinguish between `<head>` and `<header>`, **they are not the same**
