## Lab: Cookie Recipe

- Work individually or in teams to create an html version of a Cookie recipe depicted in the images below

- Using Sublime, open the folder called **cookie_recipe** files for this exercise can be found in your **starter_code**

- Tips
  - Focus on the content first, then the image then the CSS
  - There will be some items that you will need to look up, CSS is one of them (don't worry we will be going over this in the next class, but part of being a developer is being able to **google your way to solutions**)
